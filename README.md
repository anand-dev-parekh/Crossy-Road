## Updates
I created this game a while ago, so of course, there are many areas to improve in this game. I don't plan to work on this game anymore, however, if you would like, make a pull request and I'll update it! Anyways heres a list of things that should be done to this game.

1) Hash and Salt user passwords
2) Make a prettier design for the game
3) IF app gets bigger, create a simple api to update+read database
